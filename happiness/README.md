### Correlation Analysis:
- **Life Ladder and Log GDP Per Capita:** Strong positive correlation (**0.78**), indicating higher GDP correlates with higher life satisfaction scores.
- **Life Ladder and Social Support:** Strong positive correlation (**0.72**).
- **Healthy Life Expectancy:** Positive correlation with life ladder (**0.71**) and log GDP per capita (**0.82**), suggesting that economic health and life satisfaction are linked.
- **Negative Affect:** Correlates significantly with several factors, most notably the negative correlation with Life Ladder (**-0.35**), emphasizing that greater life satisfaction is linked to lower levels of negative emotional states.

### Conclusion:
This dataset provides a holistic view of the socio-economic factors that contribute to well-being across different global contexts. The strong correlations between economic indicators (like GDP) and subjective measures of well-being (like the Life Ladder) highlight the essential role of economic health in fostering individual and social satisfaction. Missing values in key areas like Generosity and Social Support indicate potential areas for further research or data collection efforts.
