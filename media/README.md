### Ratings
#### Overall, Quality, and Repeatability
- **Overall Mean Rating**: 3.05 (out of 5), suggesting a moderate level of satisfaction among the entries.
- **Quality Mean Rating**: 3.21, slightly higher than the overall rating, indicating that while entries are generally rated positively, quality is perceived as somewhat better.
- **Repeatability Mean Rating**: 1.49, indicating that entries are not often recommended for repeat viewing, as scores tend to be low.
- **Rating Ranges**:
  - Overall: 1 - 5
  - Quality: 1 - 5

- **Statistical measures** (e.g., standard deviation, quartiles) for ratings are more detailed and suggest that most entries cluster around the mean, with limited variability.

### Correlation Analysis
- The overall rating has a strong correlation (0.83) with quality, indicating that higher quality ratings generally lead to higher overall ratings.
- The correlation between overall and repeatability is moderate (0.51), suggesting some connection but with room for improvement.
- The correlation between quality and repeatability is weaker (0.31), indicating less of a relationship, suggesting that quality is somewhat independent of how often someone would want to repeat the viewing experience.

### Missing Values

### Conclusion
This dataset reflects a rich variety of films, with a majority being English language movies, predominantly classified as feature films. The ratings show a favorable perception of quality and overall satisfaction, although with notable weaknesses in repeatability. There’s room for improvement in recording complete data, particularly concerning the creators of the entries. Understanding the viewer's experience could benefit from addressing these gaps and analyzing patterns in repeatability versus quality more deeply.
